# Advent of Code 2023 solutions in Rust

[![build](https://github.com/samegens/aoc-2023-rust/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/samegens/aoc-2023-rust/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repo is my first code using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), 
to solve some of the challenges
of [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/).

What I tried to learn:

- How to set up a project with multiple binaries.
- How to create and use a shared library.
- How to write unit tests and emulate [NUnit's TestCase](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/attributes/testcase.html).
- How to work with and work around Option.
- How to work with [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/).
- How to work with [moving](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/move.html) and [borrowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html).
- How to do some common string manipulation (slicing, searching).
- How to do simple IO.
